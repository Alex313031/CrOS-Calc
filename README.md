# CrOS Calculator <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/CrOS-Calc/blob/main/imgs/calc_new_256.png" width="64">
ChromiumOS default calculator app, fixed!

Just the default ChromiumOS Calculator, (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calculator/joodangkbfjnajiiifokapkpmhfnpleo) but with the ugly green logo reverted back to the (many years standing), original Chromium blue-ish logo. Also the manifest has been updated and copy/paste loading & unloading fixed!

Ugly logo for comparison:
