# Calculator
Chromium OS default calculator app, fixed!

Just the default chrome calculator, (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calculator/joodangkbfjnajiiifokapkpmhfnpleo) but with the ugly green logo reverted back to the (many years standing), original chromium blue-ish logo. Also the Manifest has been updated and copy/paste loading & unloading fixed!

Ugly logo for comparison:

## How to Use
Simply download calc.crx, open chrome://extensions, enable developer mode (there is a toggle in the upper right hand corner of the page), then drag and drop the .crx into the page. It will prompt for installation just like any other chrome web store app.

## Version History
2.2.9 (First release) -- 2.2.8 with manifest fixed and logo replaced with original (good & proper!) one.
